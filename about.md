# About

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

I'm Giuliano, a tiny little programmer. Once a linguist.

Since Twitter has been ruined, I moved to [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/web/@giulianopz). I tried [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/giulianopz.bsky.social) but I could not really appreciate it so far.

Beyond programming, [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/168807725-giuliano-panzironi) and [music](https://www.youtube.com/@giuliano.panzironi) are things that fill my spacetime.

My cv is [here](https://giulianopz.github.io/cv/), in the unlikely event you need it.
