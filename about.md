Hi, thanks for stopping by!

I'm Giuliano, a tiny little programmer. Once a linguist. 

> Computer science and linguistics may seem quite separate fields of research but they are intertwined in an [eternal golden braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach): [people](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01007763) thinking they can contribute to each other should come as no surprise.

I think that anything can be learned through [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice) and
I live by the [Hacker Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic), but somehow mediated by [Ivan Illich](http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/)'s line of thought (people before computers). And I truly believe that it can also change the world we live in.

Personal blogs are my [favourite](./favourites.html) corners of the web, they are where I learn most. They are also the motivation for running my own blog to jot down scattered thoughts, small hacks and, more generally, everything I need to remember. 

I keep track of useful stuff about programming (paper textbooks and online resources) I come across in a sort of [bookmarks](https://giulianopz.github.io/programming/) collection in a GitHub repo. The map below from my space on [Kinopio](https://blog.kinopio.club/) summarizes some of the most interesting things I plan to study for the rest of my mortal life:

Beyond programming, [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/168807725-giuliano-panzironi) and [music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ5XiIuJMh_mMQ0Wtqh3JfIvU0-n0JLaH) are the things that fill my space and time.

Since Twitter has been [ruined](https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk) by that m@thÂ§rf$ck&r, I'm mostly active on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/web/@giulianopz).

My cv is [here](https://giulianopz.github.io/cv/), in the unlikely event you need it.
