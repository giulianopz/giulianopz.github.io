# About

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

I'm Giuliano, a tiny little programmer. Once a linguist. 

Computer science and linguistics may seem quite separate fields of research but they actually belong to the same [eternal golden braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) and have [something](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01007763) to say to each other.

I believe that anything can be learned through [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice) and
I live by the [Hacker Ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic), but mediated by [Ivan Illich](http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/)'s line of thought (people before computers).

Since Twitter has been ruined by that m@thÂ§rf$ck&r, I'm mostly active on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/web/@giulianopz).

Beyond programming, [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/168807725-giuliano-panzironi) and [music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ5XiIuJMh_mMQ0Wtqh3JfIvU0-n0JLaH) are the things that fill my space and time.

My cv is [here](https://giulianopz.github.io/cv/), in the unlikely event you need it.

This blog is about random stuff I need to jot down from time to time to refine my thinking. You can find more interesting content in my idealistic [webring](./favorites.html).
